# springfieldleafpickup
Simple JavaScript application to calculate the schedule each year for leaf pickup in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania

Just practicing some md from here since this was just a quick project and I make it avaiable for Sprigfield if they want it - AND -this doesn't work in a doc: 
```js
console.log()
```
```html
<img href="http://somewhere.com" />
```
```css
body {margin: 0 auto;}
```
```php
<?php the_content(); ?>
```
```json
{
"name": "jim",
"job": "front end developer"
}
```
```diff
- const nums = []
+ const nums = {}
```
I have the following ideas:
> idea 1
> > sub idea
> > > why nest?

>  idea 3

which is best?
